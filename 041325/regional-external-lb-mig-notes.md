# Notes for Deploying a High Availability (HA), Elastic Application with private instances

## Key Points
- Entirely regional deployment
- Private instances with no public IPs or direct internet access
- Use Cloud NAT to enable egress access for private instances
- Auto-scaling and auto-healing instances via MIG
- Internet-facing, regional HTTP Load Balancer

## Resource Provisioning Order

1. VPC

2. Firewall Rules
 or
3. Cloud NAT + Cloud Router
 or
4. Instance Template

5. Managed Instance Group (MIG) with health checks & autoscaling
6. Load Balancer with health check and proxy-only subnet

---
## Part 0 - Open Console

- Open tabs for Compute Engine, VPC, and Network Services; also a tab for the Start up script repo and one for the architecture diagram. 
- This means 5 tabs are all that is needed

## Part 1: Provision Networking Infrastructure

### Step 1 - Create a VPC

Questions to consider:
- Do we need a custom VPC or will the default work?
- How many subnets are necessary?
- Can we use default firewall rules?

Instructions:
1. Navigate to **VPC Networks**
2. Click **Create VPC**
3. Name it accordingly (e.g., `lb-lab-vpc`)
4. Create a single subnet with a /24 CIDR in your chosen region
5. Disable default firewall rules
6. Leave other options as default and create the VPC

### Step 2 - Configure Cloud NAT and Cloud Router

Questions to consider:
- What is NAT and why is it needed?
- What is a Cloud Router?
- Why do we need a Cloud Router?
- Can we do this lab a different way without this?

Instructions:
1. Go to **Network Services > Cloud NAT**
2. Click **Create NAT Gateway**
3. Name it then set NAT type to **Public**
4. Under **Router**, click **Create New Router**
    - Name it (e.g., `sunday-router`), describe it
    - Leave BGP settings as default
5. Ensure source endpoint and IPv4 mapping are correct
6. Click **Create**

### Step 3 - Configure Firewall Rules

Questions to consider:
- What is TCP:80?
- Why are we allowing this traffic?
- Can we configure it differently? 

Instructions:
1. Go to **VPC > Firewall Rules**
2. Click **Create Firewall Rule**
3. Name the firewall rule something like: "<YOUR-VPC-NAME>-<ACTION>-<PROTOCOL/PURPOSE>"
4. Description: "Allow HTTP and HC traffic"
5. Direction: **Ingress**, Action: **Allow**
6. Targets: 
     - EXTRA IMPORTANT
     - Choose specified Target tags (default)
     - Choose a tag and enter it here: 
7. Source: **All IP ranges (0.0.0.0/0)**
8. Protocols/Ports: TCP:80
9. Click **Create**

## Part 2: Provision Compute Infrastructure

### Step 1 - Create an Instance Template

Questions to consider:
- Which machine type and OS?
- Which startup script is needed?
- What networking settings are needed?

Instructions:
1. Go to **Compute Engine > Instance Templates**
2. Click **Create Instance Template**
3. Name it (e.g., `web-template`), select correct region
4. Go to advanced options at bottom of screen
5. In **Networking**:
    - IMPORTANT: add network tag you made earlier 
    - Edit the network interface
      - Choose your VPC and Subnet
      - Disable External IP
      - Click on done after reviewing this
6. In **Management > Automation**:
    - Paste startup script
7. Click **Create**

### Step 2 - Create Managed Instance Group (MIG)

Questions to consider:
- What is autoscaling and how does this help us do it?
- What is autohealing and how does this help us?
- How does this help us minmize costs? 
- How does it know when to scale? 

Instructions:
1. Go to **Compute Engine > Instance Groups**
2. Click **Create Instance Group**
3. Name it (e.g., `web-mig`), use the previously created template
4. Choose **Multiple Zones** in the same region
5. Enable autoscaling:
    - Minimum: number of zones
    - Maximum: 2Ã— zones (max 8)
6. Create a health check
     - Click on drop down menu for health check and click create health check
     - in right hand menu that opens
     - name it
     - change check interval to 10 s, and unhealth threshold to 3 
     - save
     - ensure health check is selected in instance group 
7. Click **Create**

## Part 3: Provision Load Balancer

Questions to consider:
- What does a LB do?
- What roles do the frontend and backend play?
- Why an application LB?
- Why an external or public facing LB?
- Why a regional LB? 

Instructions:
1. Go to **Network Services > Load Balancing**
2. Click **Create Load Balancer**
3. Choose: **Application Load Balancer > Public > Regional**
4. Click **Configure Load Balancer**

#### Basic Configuration
- Name the LB (e.g., `web-lb`)
- Choose region & VPC
- Create a **Proxy-only subnet** (/24 in the same range as other subnet)

#### Frontend Configuration
- Name it
- Click **Done**

#### Backend Configuration
1. Create backend service
2. Name it (e.g., `web-backend-service`)
3. Add the MIG as a backend on port 80
4. Create a health check
   - click on health check drop down
   - then click on create health check 
   - name it 
   - increase check interval to 10 s, and unhealthy threshold to 3 
5. Disable any Cloud Armor policies
6. Click **Create**

#### Final Steps
- Skip Routing Rules
- Review configuration
- Click **Create**
